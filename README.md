# Polygon-drawer
What? Why? This project started as simple help while I was developing roads system and ran into issues with drawing them on height maps. (The maps were tilted, I needed to handle corners etc. bleh)
I made it to visualise polygons to see if they made sense, after some time I ran into this again and decided the code was shit and needed rework, so many great new features are coming.

#Version
###2.0 - Complete rewrite to typescript
You can draw multiple polygons with coordinates and vectors, circle, point and detect colision between them. Collision for point is whether it is inside of any object.

###1.0 - Initial write in javascript
You can draw a polygon with coordinates and vectors.
